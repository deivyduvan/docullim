4. Customize the generated documentation as needed.
5. Integrate **docullim** into your development workflow for future projects.

## Examples

Here is a simple example of how to use **docullim** to generate documentation for a Python function:

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers and return the result.

    Parameters:
    a (int): The first number.
    b (int): The second number.
